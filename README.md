//***FILE1042 is from Frank Clarke, Oldsmar FL, and consists of one *   FILE1042
//*           routine, DEIMBED, that is meant to be copied into and *   FILE1042
//*           called from REXX routines that include their own ISPF *   FILE1042
//*           assets such as panels, skeletons, or other non-ISPF   *   FILE1042
//*           material which is to be extracted for use at          *   FILE1042
//*           execution-time.                                       *   FILE1042

//*           DEIMBED creates temporary libraries to house the      *   FILE1042
//*           extracted material needed by the routine.  These      *   FILE1042
//*           temporary libraries are flushed by the system when    *   FILE1042
//*           the routine terminates.                               *   FILE1042
